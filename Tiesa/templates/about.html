<p class="txt"> Today, most of the information is available either on paper or in the form of photographs
or videos. Large information is stored in images. Any text appearing in an image can provide
useful information for the task of automatic image annotation and other related problems. One of
the primary ways through which people share and consume information in social networks such
as Facebook is through visual media such as photos and videos. In the last several years, the
volume of photos being uploaded to social media platforms has grown exponentially to the order
of hundreds of millions every day, presenting technological challenges for processing increasing
volumes of visual information. One of the challenges in image understanding is related to the
retrieval of textual information from images, also called Optical Character Recognition (OCR),
which represents a process of conversion of electronic images containing typed, printed, painted
or scene text into machine encoded text. Obtaining such textual information from images is
important as it facilitates many different applications, e.g. search and recommendation of images.</p>
<p class="txt"> Following state-of-the-art systems, OCR system is divided into a text detection stage and
a text recognition stage. Our text detection approach, based on Faster-RCNN model, is
responsible of detecting regions of the image that contain text. After that, our text recognition
approach, that uses a fully-convolutional character-based recognition model, processes the
detected locations and recognizes the text they contain. Text detection is an important
preliminary step before text can be recognized in unconstrained image environments. We present
an approach based on convolutional neural networks to detect and localize horizontal text lines
from raw color pixels. The network learns to extract and combine its own set of features through
learning instead of using hand-crafted ones. Learning was also used in order to precisely localize
the text lines by simply training the network to reject badly-cut text and without any use of
tedious knowledge-based postprocessing.</p></div></div></div>
